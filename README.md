# CONNECT-iPhone

Today, communication is difficult for the deaf. Ninety percent of deaf kids have hearing parents and of those, only about twenty percent know sign language; communication between them is usually very limited, if not impossible. The connect iOS app bridges this gap and enables two-way communication by converting both speech to text and text back to speech. Integration with the SmartSign dictionary also allows users to learn sign language by showing them how to sign certain words.

## Release Notes
  Software Features in this Release:<br />
    * SmartSign Integration<br />
  Bug Fixes from Last Release:<br />
    * Can now do both speech-to-text and text-to-speech without app crashing<br />
  Known Bugs and Defects:<br />
    * If you type a really long quick phrase, the newly added quick phrase text at the bottom would decrease in size immensely to fit in the allotted space.<br />
    * If you add a quick phrase that was already there, it will still add the quick phrase. The quick phrases at the bottom, should only add unique quick phrases.
