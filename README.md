# ${1:CONNECT-iPhone}

Today, communication is difficult for the deaf. Ninety percent of deaf kids have hearing parents and of those, only about twenty percent know sign language; communication between them is usually very limited, if not impossible. The connect iOS app bridges this gap and enables two-way communication by converting both speech to text and text back to speech. Integration with the SmartSign dictionary also allows users to learn sign language by showing them how to sign certain words.
